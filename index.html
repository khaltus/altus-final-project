     <h3>Mona Lisa</h3>
     <p>One of the most famous and mysterious paintings in the world, Leonardo da Vinci started this masterpiece in Florence, Italy in 1503. Although the woman’s identity is officially unknown, it’s believed to be Lisa Gherardini, wife of a Florentine cloth merchant. To this day, no one knows who commissioned the painting or how long da Vinci worked on it.

     <p>This oil paint on wood piece was done by famous Italian artist Raphael in 1504 as an altarpiece for the convent of Sant’ Antonio in Perugia.

     <p>Veronese painted this iconic piece in 1553 after he was invited to work in Venice and let his artistic creativity and interpretation run free. Here, he depicts Christ’s first miracle at a wedding feast where Jesus turned water into wine, but instead of Galilee, the setting is Venetian.

     <h3>The Lacemaker</h3>
     <p>Considered one of Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer’s masterpieces, this 1669 artwork is considered an intimate portrait of a young lacemaker. It’s speculated that the book she’s working over is the Bible, mixing the concepts of mortal work and religion. Vermeer is praised for his contrast of colors and realistic concentration of the model.

     <p>Rembrandt created this in 1653 as his meditation on the meaning of fame. Greek philosopher Aristotle is pictured resting his hand on a bust of Homer, the famous poet who wrote “Iliad” and “Odyssey.” It’s believed Aristotle is comparing his own success to Homer’s timeless achievements.

     <p>This oil painting of Saint Barbara was likely an altarpiece in a Puerto Rican church, created by an unknown artist. Her symbols are the crown, a palm and the three-window tower where she was imprisoned by her father. Santa Barbara specifically protects against hurricanes, so her image is hung in houses and churches.

     <h3>Portrait of Louis XIV</h3>
     <p>Painted by French artist Hyacinthe Rigaud in 1701, Louis XIV commissioned this piece as a gift. At the time this was painted, Louis XIV was 63 and had been the king of France for 58 years already. Here, he’s in his coronation robes which show the royal fleur de lys. It was said he liked to show off his legs, and when he saw this portrait, he liked it so much he ended up keeping it.

     <h3>Death of Socrates</h3>
     <p>In 1787, French painter Jacques Louis David aimed to accurately depict the death of Greek philosopher Socrates, who died by order of the courts for his "improper behavior towards the gods" by corrupting the minds of his followers. Socrates spoke on the immortality of the soul before he died willingly by drinking from a poisonous cup.

     <h3>Liberty Leading the People</h3>
     <p>Inspired by an event he witnessed with his own eyes, Eugene Delacroix depicts in 1830 France’s Trois Glorieuses. In just three days, France’s Republic overthrew the Monarchy, and Delacroix imagined a lady liberty leading the people, beautiful with a bright yellow dress. She appears rebellious and victorious, and ultimately represents France’s freedom.

     <h3>Washington Crossing the Delaware</h3>
     <p>In 1851, German-American artist Emanuel Leutze recreated Washington’s raid on the Hessians at Trenton in 1776. He started the first painting in 1849, but it was damaged in a studio fire in 1850. After it was restored, it was damaged again in 1942 due to a bomb raid. Leutze had to ultimately exhibit a second version which was completed in 1851. Source: <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/en/art/collection/search/11417">The MET Curatorial Department</a></p>

     <h3>The Pilgrim of the Cross at the End of His Journey</h3>
     <p>This painting is part of a series titled “The Cross and the World,” which was the last project Thomas Cole worked on in 1848 before he died. The paintings tell the story of one pilgrim that follows the cross and one that follows the world. In the end, the pilgrim that follows the cross discovers light and redemption, while the worldly pilgrim finds emptiness.

     <p>It’s one of Claude Monet’s most recognizable series: Water Lilies, 1915. In the Louvre’s garden Musee de l’Orangerie is showcased a unique set of canvases called the “Sixtine of Impressionism.” Eight panels create a 360 degree horizon of waterlilies. In total, the paintings cover over 100 square meters of wall space. Source: <a href="https://www.musee-orangerie.fr/en/article/set-orangerie">Musee l'Orangerie Curatorial Department</a></p>

     <h3>States of Mind: Those Who Go</h3>
     <p>Using ink on paper, Italian artist Umberto Boccioni created this abstract piece in Milan in 1912. It was part of a series studying people at train stations: those who go, those who stay, and the farewells. Using straight lines and thoughtful shading, Boccioni contrasts between arrivals and departures.

     <h3>Fishing Boats at Gloucester</h3>
     <p>This painting is a perfect example of the popular Impressionist style of the 1900s. Artist John Henry Twachtman moved to Gloucester, Massachusetts after falling into depression when his wife and children left him. The waterfront town gave him a new vision, and he started using whispy strokes and geometric angles on his canvases.
